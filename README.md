# odin-sub-strings

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-sub-strings).
It implements a `#substrings` function that takes in a string as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your *dictionary*) as the second argument.
It returns a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
